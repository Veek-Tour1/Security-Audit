# Findings & Analysis

## Local Infrastructure Assessment

### ✅ Implemented Controls
- Basic network segmentation
- Antivirus software on workstations
- Physical security (guards, access cards)

### Power & Connectivity Challenges
| Issue | Impact | Local Context |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| **Intermittent Power** | Database corruption risk | Generator fuel costs impacting operational budget |
| **Single ISP Dependency** | Service downtime | Heavy reliance on MainOne/MTN with no failover |
| **Mobile Network Reliance** | Insecure data transmission | Field teams using Glo/Airtel networks for data transfer |

### Legacy System Constraints
- **Windows Server 2008 R2**: Out-of-support OS running land records database
- **Manual Data Entry**: High error rate in land parcel information
- **Paper-Based Workflows**: Physical documents not digitized, creating data gaps

## Nigerian Regulatory Compliance Gaps

### NDPR 2019 Violations
| Article | Requirement | Current Status |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Article 2.1** | Data Security Measures | ❌ No encryption for citizen data |
| **Article 2.6** | Data Protection Impact Assessment | ❌ Never conducted |
| **Article 4.1(3)** | Lawful Processing | ⚠️ Consent mechanisms inadequate |

### NITDA Framework Gaps
- **Guideline 4.2**: Data classification not implemented
- **Guideline 6.1**: Incident response plan missing
- **Guideline 7.3**: Employee awareness training not conducted

### Lagos State ICT Policy Alignment
| Policy Requirement | Current Status | Gap Analysis |
|-------------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Data Center Standards** | ❌ Non-compliant | Server room lacks adequate cooling and fire suppression |
| **Network Security** | ⚠️ Partial | Basic firewall but no intrusion detection |
| **Disaster Recovery** | ❌ Missing | No backup strategy for critical land records |

## Local Threat Landscape

### Nigeria-Specific Cyber Threats
- **Social Engineering**: Targeting government staff for land fraud
- **Ransomware**: High risk to unprotected land records database
- **Insider Threats**: Underpaid staff vulnerable to bribes for land data access

### Physical Security Considerations
- **Location**: Alausa, Ikeja - high-density government area
- **Access Control**: Shared building with multiple ministries
- **Document Storage**: Physical land records vulnerable to theft/damage
